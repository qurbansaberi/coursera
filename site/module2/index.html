          <p>Kabuli Pulao or Afghani Pulao is a savory Central Asian dish that has many variations. It is often prepared with cauliflower, cabbage, carrots and various kinds of nuts. Traditionally cooked with large pieces of lamb, Kabuli Pulao is equally delicious when made with beef. There is even a vegetarian version that substitutes meat with stew-style vegetables. This is a healthy and hearty dish that works just as well in the summers as in winters. The combination of textures, colors and nutritional value make this a popular dish that can be had as a complete meal.</p>
